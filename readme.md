ALERT
==================
I've abandoned this plugin that implements DirectPayment towards using WebPayment. See mangopay_edd_plugin_web on this github account. This is because I couldn't manage with Mangopay support to solve two issues that happens both when trying to update *CardRegistrations->RegistrationData* with token server data response. 

First error is an sporadic *500 - InternalError*, caused by too long data code; this is what I got from support:

- We pay particular attention on this problem since and we got a response from our IT
team. They said that the stack is due to the update of RegistrationData (PUT on
/cardregistrations), the information is too big to be treated. So in our next API
update we will increase this field size.

Second error is *code 105206 - Registration data: invalid format*. For this error, Mangopay support just skipped answering or giving any piece of information. As we say in spanish: que si quieres arroz Catalina.

So maybe in the future... please see WebPayment method implementation: https://github.com/aleph1888/mangopay_edd_plugin_web
